        <p>
            Hi and welcome to my blog! My name is Sarah aka the author of this blog. A little about me, I am a senior at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Information Science with a concentration in Human Centered Technologies and a minor in Information Technology. I spent my first two years of college at Delaware State University on their D1 Equestrian team. I grew up in Michigan and hope to live here for the rest of my life.

            As for my hobbies, I already mentioned I was on a D1 team so yes that means I am an equestrian (I jump horses of sticks). I am also a photographer and I have a very small side business taking portraits of people and animals. When I am not doing school work or being with the horses, I am doing normal college student things. I like stress baking, hanging out with friends, doom scrolling tiktok, rotting in bed, and watching random tv shows.
